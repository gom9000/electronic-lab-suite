# Electronic Suite
Personal hub of electronics-related repositories, organized by category.<br/>
The work here grows from documented experiences: instruments are built after the theory is experienced, libraries emerge from repeated practice, projects are the result of both.<br/>
A repository may appear in more than one section when it belongs to more than one category.

These projects follow a KIS (Keep It Simple) approach: building with what is available, standard-grade components included. The constraint is part of the design, requiring extra attention to detail to ensure that hardware limitations never compromise final reliability.

## Lab — Instruments & Test Equipment
Custom-built instruments and tools designed to equip the electronics workbench.

### **[Multi Out Low-Power Supply Unit](https://github.com/gom9000/mopsu)**
**Type**: Power Supply | **Status**: Completed

A versatile, multi-rail linear low-power supply unit (3.3V, 5V, 9V, 12V) designed to power bench prototypes.


### **[Diode Tester](https://github.com/gom9000/diode-tester)**
**Type**: Component Tester | **Status**: Testing

Measure the forward voltage drop ($V_f$) of diodes or the working voltage of Zener diodes under selectable currents (1mA, 2mA, 5mA, 10mA, 20mA, 30mA).


### **Dummy Load for Low-Power PSU *(coming soon)***
**Type**: Active Load | **Status**: Development

## XP — Documented Experiences
A series of documented laboratory experiences exploring specific components, techniques, and design approaches. Each repository collects experiments with theoretical background and empirical results, and often serves as the foundation for lab instruments or standalone projects.

### **[PSU Dummy Load eXPerience](https://github.com/gom9000/xp-dummyload)**
**Type**: Dummy Load | **Status**: Development

A series of documented laboratory experiences on building simple dummy loads to test small PSUs.

### **[PowerBank PSU eXPerience](https://github.com/gom9000/xp-powerbank)**
**Type**: Power Supply | **Status**: Development

Design experiences and calculations for powering multiple 9V audio stomp boxes, exploring different power sources from external adapters to direct mains connection.

### **[RaspberryPI eXPerience](https://github.com/gom9000/xp-raspberry)**
**Type**: Hardware Interfacing | **Status**: Ongoing

A collection of experiments focused on interfacing the RaspberryPi with the external world, covering MIDI protocols, shift registers (74HC595/165), and quadrature encoders.

### **[SwitchBank eXPerience](https://github.com/gom9000/xp-switchbank)**
**Type**: Hardware Interfacing | **Status**: Concept

A study on the classification and implementation of switch-bank circuits (arrays and matrices), focusing on momentary switches.
